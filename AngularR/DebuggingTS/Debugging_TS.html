1. Setting types


2. Setting the types for function parameters


3. Optional parameters


4. Interfaces and function parameters
- Create an object, using "interface".
- The interface will decide what object attributes it the function's object will have.
- Make a constant will be the attributes
- When the function is run, the parametor will hold the constat which has all the attibutes that the blueprint woudl require to create the instance. 

5. Classes and function parameters
- The Ninja class has an fullname attribute, in order to get what it is, it is given a first name and a last name in the constructure, which get

class Ninja {
    fullName: string;
    constructor(
       public firstName: string,
       public lastName: string){
          this.fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
       }
    debug(){
       console.log("Console.log(shane) is my friend.")
    }
 }
 // This is not making an instance of Ninja, for some reason:
 const shane = new Ninja("Shane","O'Leary");
 console.log(shane);
 console.log(shane.fullName);
 // Since I'm having trouble making an instance of Ninja, I decided to do this:
 const turing = {
    fullName: "Alan Turing"
 }
 // Now I'll make a study function, which is a lot like our graduate function from above:
 function study(programmer: Ninja){
    return `Ready to whiteboard an algorithm, ${programmer.fullName}?`
 }
 // Now this has problems:
 console.log(study(turing));

6. Arrow functions

var increment = x => x + 1;
// This works great:
console.log(increment(3));
var square = x => {x * x};
// This is not showing me what I want:
console.log(square(4));
// This is not working:
var multiply = (x,y) => x * y;
// Nor is this working:
var math = (x, y) => {
    let sum = x + y;
    let product = x * y;
    let difference = Math.abs(x - y);
    return [sum, product, difference];
}


7. Arrow functions and 'this'

class Elephant {
    constructor(public age: number){}
    birthday = function(){
       this.age++;
    }
 }
 const babar = new Elephant(8);
 setTimeout(babar.birthday(), 1000)
 setTimeout(function(){
    console.log(`Babar's age is ${babar.age}.`)
    }, 2000)
